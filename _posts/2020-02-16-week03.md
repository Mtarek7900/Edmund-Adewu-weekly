### Recap
This week, the basics of the Git VCS workflow were explored. To be specific, the process of cloning an existing repository, modifying it locally, and pushing it back to the main branch for submission purposes was demonstrated. In addition, command line repository management was reviewed. Existing open source projects were explored as a means of developing project contribution criteria.
