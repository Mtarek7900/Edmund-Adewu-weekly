### Project and Installation Continued
__3/12/2020__: After navigating to the proper subfolder, I ran the command `yarn run bootstrap`.
The 'prepare script' procedure took 547.67 seconds. The first part of dependency installation took 216.4 seconds

As for the tests, the initial yarn test was successful, with all tests and test suites passing. However, subsequent tests kept failing. To be specific, the error in question was an async function whose execution exceeded the maximum runtime.
