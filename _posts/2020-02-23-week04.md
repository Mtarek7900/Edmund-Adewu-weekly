title: Week 4

## Projects of interest: 
* [Facebook Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly)
* [File Converter](https://github.com/Tichau/FileConverter)
* [Free Code Camp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)
* [LibreOffice](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core)
* [Codezilla](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla)

## Rejects:
* File Converter: I find file converters, particular free ones, to be very useful, especially when acquiring academic and recreational materials. Unfortunately, the primary language used to create the tool is C# which, given the limited timeframe to contribute to a project, would be impractical to learn. There doesn't appear to be a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` file present. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file 
is located in the wiki tab, a rather obscure location. The most recent commit was 3 years ago. 

* LibreOffice: The only core files present on the GitHub repository are the license, under `COPYING`, and the `README`. Even then, there happen to be multiple versions of each. The repository itself doesn't list the primary languages at the top, although the `README`  puts emphasis on C++/C. The amount of code is vast, clocking in at 9.51 million lines of code according to [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/p/libreoffice/analyses/latest/languages_summary) statistics. The issues on [Gerrit](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/q/status:open) don't contain any labels related to the level of complexity (i.e. beginner, advanced, etc.).

## Other Work:
* I added the Bronx branch of the Harbor Freight Tools hardware store chain to the map. In addition, I started to read th Wikipedia guidelines to making contributions.
