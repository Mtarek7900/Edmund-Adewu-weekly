## Projects of interest: 
* [Facebook Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly)
* [File Converter](https://github.com/Tichau/FileConverter)
* [Free Code Camp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)
* [LibreOffice](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core)
* [Codezilla](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla)

## Rejects:
* File Converter: I find file converters, particular free ones, to be very useful, especially when acquiring academic and recreational materials. 
Unfortunately, the primary language used to create the tool is C# which, given the limited timeframe to contribute to a project, would be impractical to learn.
In addition, the contribution instructions are located in the wiki tab, a rather obscure location.
