title: Week 5

## Recap: 
This week, the class was split into groups and assigned different open source projects to evaluate. My group was assigned GNOME Web (Epiphany),
an open source web browser. For something that functions like Firefox, Google Chrome and Explorer Edge, the project was surprisingly small,
containing a little over 156,000 lines of code. For reference, Firefox has at least 20 million lines of code.

Finting answers to the quantifiable questions was rather vexing. For one, the relevant repository hosting service used was GitLab, not GihHub,
meaning that many of the information retrieval tips for GitHub did not apply.
