### About Me
Welcome! My name is Edmund Adewu. I am an undergraduate student currently pursuing a degree in computer science at Hunter College.

Computer software is of great interest to me. It is, amongst other things, capable of entertaining the masses, mending fractured communities and improving humanity's understanding of the universe. Traditional classroom lectures and independent resources, while indeed very informative, can be somewhat daunting to navigate, let alone implement in a practical manner. By analyzing and contributing to real-world projects, I aim to enhance my understanding of programming concepts and cultivate the ability to develop meaningful applications that could best serve the public.

### Further Information
* I possess intermediate knowledge of Java and C++.
* I am proficient with the Microsoft Office and Google suites.
* My hobbies include, but are not limited to, reading, sewing, learning about stock investing, manga and DIY.
